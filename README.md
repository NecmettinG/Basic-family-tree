# Basic-family-tree
A basic family tree I made for my class project homework.
The program will stop working and print the family tree if a person has no kids or he/she hasn't married.
The max generation will be 3. That means, It will only print 1st generation (grandfather, grandmother), 2nd gen. (mother, father) and 3rd (kids).
